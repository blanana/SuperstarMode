# SuperstarMode

This is a mod for Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach that makes the game signifficantly harder and also adds things like my own LORE (get MatPat on this lmao), another Ending (Jim), more Achievements (13) and Bowling (yes! Bowling!)

I tried keeping the game (somewhat) fair so that it wouldn't be an unenjoyable mess (idk how that worked out, this game can already be a mess without mods)

If you think this is still too easy for you, try playing the Chaos Mod or getting a timely response from Spiff

The mod is made out of two parts: A Logic mod (SuperstarMode.pak) and a Pak Patch (SuperstarMode_P.pak)

Logic Mods can run code while Pak Patches can overwrite existing game files

I would love to list all the Changes I made here but I don't want to looks through the code again but if there is enough demand, I'll make a video explaining it

Notes:
- set Brightness, Contrast and Gamma to their default values

(It can cause Crashing and Memory Leaks in some Systems and is not required for this Mod Launcher)
