# SuperstarMode

This is a mod for Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach that makes the game signifficantly harder and also adds things like my own LORE (get MatPat on this lmao), more Achievements and Bowling (yes! Bowling!)

I tried keeping the game (somewhat) fair so that it wouldn't be an unenjoyable mess (idk how that worked out, this game can already be a mess without mods)

If you think this is still too easy for you, try playing the Chaos Mod or getting a timely response from Spiff

The mod is made out of two parts: A Logic mod (SuperstarMode.pak) and a Pak Patch (SuperstarMode_P.pak)

Logic Mods can run code while Pak Patches can overwrite existing game files

I would love to list all the Changes I made here but I don't want to looks through the code again but if there is enough demand, I'll make a video explaining it
