# SuperstarMode

This is a mod for Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach that makes the game signifficantly harder and also adds features like, my own LORE (get MatPat on this lmao), more Achievements and Bowling (yes! Bowling!)
I tried keeping the game (somewhat) fair so that it wouldn't be an unenjoyable mess (idk how that worked out, this game can already be a mess without mods)
If you think this is still too easy for you, try playing the Chaos Mod or getting a timely response from Spiff
The mod is made out of two parts: A Logic mod (SuperstarMode.pak) and a Pak Patch (SuperstarMode_P.pak)
Logic Mods can run code while Pak PAtches can overwrite existing game files
I would love to list all the Changes I made here but I don't want to looks through the code again
